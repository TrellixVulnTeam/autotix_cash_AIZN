# AutoTix Cash
Part of the AutoTix series to simplify cash tracking for runners and the ISP team.

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, Bootstrap, Python, Django

## Optimizations
The original app was a simple web application using HTML and JavaScript. If the user refreshed the page, the information would be lost. Using Python and Django allowed each runner to create their own account to save the information they wanted to track.

## Lessons Learned
The runner team uses different iPhones each day and the ISP used desktops. It was important to make the application accessible and appear consistent on all devices.
